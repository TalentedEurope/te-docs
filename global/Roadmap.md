#Roadmap#

This document specifies our approximate roadmap until beta. 

##Alpha 1##
Will consist on a landing page, a sample demo application with simple features (login, validator list of pending jobs, basic student profile), and backend panels for administrator, institution, validator roles.

- **Done:** Build the entire application model, database seeds for development and base admin role panel.
- **Done:** Build a public landing page for the project. 
- Decide if we use Angular Rest admin for the Institution, Validator and Admin roles *(admin isn't exactly a priority since we have a working admin role panel right now)*.
- Stablish multilanguage codebase and translate the landing page to multiple languages.
- Add extra marketing/tracking features to the subscribe form and footer data protection warning.
- Build the institution and validator panels + their API.
- Add extra features to the api so we can build a simple mobile application.
- Finally decide the runtime we're going to use for the mobile app, building the same demo application on different runtimes 

##Alpha 2##
Will include the completion of the translation tools,  user registration and profile search for companies.

- Build the profile search tool, and the public profile views and its related actions like messaging storing views etc.
- Basic user registration for all profiles.
- Finish the profile views and add search to the mobile application
- Extend the landing page to include a prelaunch view

##Alpha 3##
Completing Alpha 3 means we arrive at beta stage. So that means that finishing it will have the application feature complete.

- Build the final homepage
-  â€‹Finish the user registration
-  Finish all the company views.
-  Build the statistics export/view
-  Add the final touches to the mobile application.
-  Finish the translation tools, importing xls to internal Laravel format.
-  Integrate translations.
